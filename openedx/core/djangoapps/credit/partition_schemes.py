"""
Partition scheme for in-course reverification.

This is responsible for placing users into one of two groups,
ALLOW or DENY, for a partition associated with a particular
in-course reverification checkpoint.

NOTE: This really should be defined in the verify_student app,
which owns the verification and reverification process.
It isn't defined there now because (a) we need access to this in both Studio
and the LMS, but verify_student is specific to the LMS, and
(b) in-course reverification checkpoints currently have messaging that's
specific to credit requirements.
